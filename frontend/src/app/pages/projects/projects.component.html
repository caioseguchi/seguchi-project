        I'm always looking for ways to learn by doing, which is why I created
        this site. "Seguchi" is my first project using Angular — a framework I
        was curious about and decided to explore. Rather than play it safe, I
        wanted to challenge myself and build something fun and useful while
        learning.

        This portfolio is where I put into practice what I learned during my
        time at NCI, as well as new topics I'm studying. Thanks for visiting —
        feel free to explore my projects!
